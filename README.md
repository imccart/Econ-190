# Econ 190: Current Issues in U.S. Health Care

This is a Freshman Seminar focusing on current issues in U.S. health care, taught by [Ian McCarthy](http://ianmccarthyecon.com) at Emory University. The official syllabus can be found [here](Syllabus/Econ190-Syllabus.pdf). I put most of the course materials and links on this site because it's a little easier than accessing links through a PDF. Below is the outline of topics that I hope to cover throughout this semester, as well as a description of the weekly assignments. 


## Course Outline
The course is broadly organized into two parts: one on current issues and one on future challenges. For each topic below, I provide a link to the underlying material for that topic (mainly podcasts).

## Assignments
Your grade in this class will be determined by weekly homework assignments (no exams). Each assignment is the same and consists of two parts:

1. Before the start of class each week, write down your own understanding of the topic for that week and one question about that topic for which you'd like an answer. You must submit these on Canvas <b>before class<b> each week.

2. At the end of each week, try to answer the question you posed and correct any misunderstandings you had at the beginning of the week.

Full credit will be given for completing both parts to each assignment. There are no wrong answers. There will be at least 12 assignments in the semester, 10 of which will go toward your final grade. That means you should get 2 weeks to miss an assignment. Please use those sparingly!
